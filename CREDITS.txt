Special thanks to Deadlock for creating Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders and to 
shanemadden for maintaining it.

Also thanks billbo99 for some modding advice and for the idea for the High pressure offshore pump.
He also made some other nice mods related to Deadlock's Stacking. Check them out.


This mod is an add-on for Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders by shanemadden and 
Deadlock. It is not an official expansion. 
It requires Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders to be installed, but it is not related 
to Deadlock in any other way.


The code was created by me and the graphics, other than the ones stated below, are edited (by me) 
versions of graphics from the factorio base game.


The thumbnail contains a beltbox icon by Deadlock and stacked ore icons from Deadlock Stacking for
Vanilla by billbo99.

The 3 stacked layers on the foreground of the icon for the Resource compression planner are an 
edited and downscaled version of an icon named stacked by Kuber from the Noun Project.
