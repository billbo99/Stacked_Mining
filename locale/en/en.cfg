[technology-description]
stacked-mining-tech=Advances in technology allow us to extract entire stacks of ores instead of single items. Mining time and yield stay the same overall.

kyth-overwrite-deadlock-stack-size=Overwrite of compression factor (Stack size)

[mod-setting-description]
kyth-overwrite-deadlock-stack-size=Allow overwrite of the stack size selected in Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders mod of stacked ore and manually set the factor that the ore is compressed by.\n[color=#8CB9E3]Useful in case some other mod makes changes to the Deadlock's Stacking stack size. This should be the same as the number of items making up each stacked item.[/color]\nIf the default "disabled" is selected, the stack size is automatically set to the value selected in the settings of Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders.\n[color=orange]WARNING: It is recommended to not change this setting or the Stack size setting in the mod settings of Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders mid game.[/color]\nDefault: disabled
kyth-high-pressure-offshore-pump=If the mod Pressurized Fluids is enabled, adds a High pressure offshore pump that outputs High-pressurized water directly, but at a lower rate than a normal offshore pump.\n[color=#8CB9E3]The pressurized output/second is adjusted automatically depending on the fluid compression rate selected in the settings of Pressurized fluids, meaning the (uncompressed) output/second stays the same overall.[/color]\nIf FactorioExtended Plus Transport is enabled, this also adds a High pressure offshore pump Mk2.\n[color=#8CB9E3]Default: enabled[/color]
kyth-adjust-stage-counts=If enabled, the "stage_counts" of ores that are marked for stacked mining are changed in such a way that the same graphics are used as before they were marked.\n[color=#8CB9E3]"stage_counts" is a list of values that define which stage of the animation is used depending on the amount of an ore patch.[/color]\nDisabling this setting makes it easier to distinguish between normal ore and ore marked for stacked mining, because of the change of the graphics. However, ore patches with a low amount of ore can look quite barren.\n[color=#8CB9E3]Default: disabled[/color]
